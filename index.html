    <h1>
      Hello Im Wij!
    </h1>
    <p>
      I have been programming for 6 years, I am completely self taught
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience in fields such as<br>
      Game Development<br>
      Compiler Development<br>
      Graphics Programming<br>
      full stack web-dev<br>
      Other general software engineering fields
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently working on a CAD design program/suite for Jets,Jet Engines, and other general aviation applications<br>
      I am also working on a compiler called fien<br>
      both of these are closed source as of now due to not being in a state where I would want to open source them
    </p>
    <p>
      I try to keep a focus on simplicity in my systems, simplicity like in a mechanical system will lead to less failure and easier fixes<br>
      I also try to keep a relatively high standard of maintainibility, readability, and speed in my code to complement the above mentioned simplicity<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Engineering</h1>
    <p>
      SOLIDWORKS is my CAD design program of choice, although I do have experience with other applications<br>
      such as fusion 360, and onshape<br>
      I like to design simple mechanical and electrical systems with minimal wear and tear<br>
      through a clever placement, use of, and intuitive understanding of magnets.<br> 
    </p>
